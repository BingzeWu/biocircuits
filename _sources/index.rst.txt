Biological Circuit Design
=============================================================

This course focuses on quantitative studies of cellular and developmental systems in biology, including the architecture of specific genetic circuits controlling microbial behaviors and multicellular development in model organisms. Topics are approached from experimental, theoretical and computational perspectives. Our goals for the class are (a) to build understanding of key principles of systems biology and (b) to develop skills for modeling and analysis of genetic circuits.
