Citing biocircuits
==================

Because this package is primarily pedagogical in nature and evolves according to the needs of the *Biological Circuit Design* book and and associated classes at `Caltech <http://caltech.edu/>`_, it has at best a stable-ish API. It is therefore very important to include a version number when citing the package. It is best to cite the package using its DOI. Here is a citation for version 0.1.0.
